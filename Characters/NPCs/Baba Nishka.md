# [[Baba Nishka]]
Entrepreneur and Traveling Merchant. An elderly Human man from Aubervale, a practicing Stranger and friend of Gill and recent semi-permanent fixture around Grimsby.

### My vibe is part street performer, part information booth, part folksy wanderer, but 100% a friendly old weirdo that's eager to help.
Voice
- Old, high, slavic, lisp? - It is only game, why you have to be mad?
Intro
- You can call me Baba Nishka! Traveling entrepreneur, purveyor of obscurities, vendor of remedies! If you need something, ole Nishka knows where it is, or knows WHO knows where it is.
Appearance
- Height - Shorter - 5'4"
- Eyes - Wrinkled, smiley
- Face - Big nose and ears, pointy chin
- Hair - Wisps of thin greywhite
- Skin - leathery, tan, wrinkly, hairy
- Age - Older - 65

### Nishka only wants to help people find what they need, and for them to savor the moment that they realized the found it!
### I want to make people feel welcome wherever they are, because everywhere should be home.
### I need to find out what this Hair-Pin is and how I came to find it... But I can't because I don't remember and that terrifies me.
