## Backstory
Who were you before becoming an Adventurer?
### Childhood
- Noble daughter of the lesser known [[House Blayney]] that rose to prominence for their control and distribution of [[Moor Bell]], an herb/flower native to Dorramere's Moors that can be used as an antiseptic and to treat necrosis.
- Enjoyed a life of modest luxury, was tutored, etc.
- Accomplished botanist, carrying on in the family name
- When the Blight started, you became fixated on a strange type of mushroom you had not yet seen that seemed to prefer infecting Moor Bell
- You're a bit out of your depth, but you're certain these are Magical Shrooms!
	- Merecap? - Necromantic Fungus with Healing Properties, primary ingredient in Potion of Cure Wounds
### Coming of Age
Horrible Accident - 
- At your Father's insistence, your house meets with several prominent Guild Masters to see how best to deal with the Blight
- You suspect that the Alchemist's Guild are using your family to grow and harvest merecap, and not stop the blight at all.
- You tried to create a bio-weapon to unleash on the Guild, but it spread out of control during your Awakening
- Wake up hours afterward, unsure who's alive or dead, flee in a panic
- People don't know what happened, many think it was divine wrath for your family not following the Her Holy Word. Others think it was politically motivated, but most all agree it was a catastrophe that likely claimed the lives of the culprit
### Adulthood
- You go into hiding after the accident, crossing the kingdom to the border of the Witchwood
- You become very self sufficient and able to live in the woods with little to no contact from others
- Found old abandoned lodge, slowly Crafted/grew into a cottage to call your own. This is how you first meet Taps.
- Slowly you've became more comfortable with other humans, helping and offering medical/alchemical/botantical advice...
#### Successes
- All things considered, you're a capable woman that has made her own way in the world
#### Struggles
- You've made peace with your circumstances
- You occasionally relapse into guilt and grief, but your disfigurement and life of solitude are often penance enough.
#### Lifestyle
- Likes coziness, but is at home among any plants. Prefers damp, dark, and warm... Like a mushroom!
## Social
### Family
- House ???? of Dorramere. - Rulers of Eddlebury?.
- Lord and Lady ??? - Parents were kinda wankers. Old money stuck in their ways, but they provided a very comfortable life for you. Favored your Sister, but encouraged your studies and hired your tutor.
- Younger Brother - cute lil kid, pretends to play knight, you like to pretend to be different monsters that he can slay, with carnivorous plants being your specialty.
- Older Sister - next in line, good sibling, but a little superficial. A model maiden, devout follower of the Lady, and a gossipy noble.
### Friends
- [[Baba Nishka]] - Aubervale based traveling trader from a nearby village - An incredibly strange and particular old man, that is equal parts friendly and boisterous. He operates as a middleman when you want to maintain a level of anonymity. He has never steered you wrong, is a stickler for clear, concise agreements, and is as discreet as you want he to be. 
- A Silent Keeper of the Chapel of Night - makes regular orders of medicine. She seems very kind, but incredibly sad. You hadn't seen her face until she lifted her veil when you asked her name, but she only shook her head in reply with a smile.
- Taps - Friendly, but not well-known. You seem to be traveling in the same circles, and both clearly share a love for nature and specifically your shared homeland
### Mentors and Colleagues
- [[Master Remi Daeucort]] - Lizard Vanaqi Tutor - Former high-ranking member of the Alchemist's Guild. Left after the Master broke his oath and prioritized wealth over helping those in need. A strange man with a flare for the dramatic. A good teacher, a brilliant doctor, but very unorthodox in his methods.
### Rivals and Enemies
- Alchemist's Guild can't be trusted, but you are unsure how involved they actually are.
- Ser Fredric of House Victor - an older Knight from Ascheffenwald that your Sister fancied. He gave you his favor when you were young at the Princess' Birthday at Court.
