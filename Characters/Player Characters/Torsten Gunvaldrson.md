### Expression

## Personality
- Gruff, but protective - You try to tell it like it is and cut through the bullshit, but you may come off callous, even when trying to spare those your care about from harm. Sometimes a vaguely hostile presence can prevent a conflict without even lifting a finger.
- A bit cocky, but all for a good story - A true Jotn would never back down from a chance to prove their worth. Even a hilarious failure can make for a great story, plus a hero must face the risk of failure for their successes to be heroic.
- Not a smart man, but smart enough to surround himself with smart people - You don't want to sell yourself short, but if you know you're out of your depth, you're not too proud to follow instead of lead.

## Backstory
Who were you before becoming an Adventurer?
### Childhood
- Birth parents were of the Bear Clan and Ghoosthoof Tribe of the northern wilds, 
	- they were killed in mob violence
- Kept as slave/punishment, forced to flee into the wilderness
- Found by Elk Clan Chieftain and taken in as a son. Given a traditional Elk (Wolf) Clan upbringing. More insular than most Clans, but also pretty well adjusted and self sufficient by Jotn standards.
### Coming of Age
- Fled the Ghosthoof Tribe into the wastes, survived alone, as a child until you found the Elk Clan...
- Could be later with the Elk Clan as part of a ceremony or whatever
### Adulthood
- Became proficient hunter - Learned a lot from being Jarl's adopted son.
- Joined the Raiders? to help defend the Clan after an unknown clan hunts the herd until near extinction...
- Groomed for succession to Jarl, but needs to go on a questspringa
#### Successes
- 
#### Struggles
- 
#### Lifestyle
Rugged, but appreciates comforts when they are available
## Social
### Family
- [[Elgjotskin]] - Elk Clan - Family and Clan are largely interchangeable for most Jotn in the North.
- [[Gunvaldr]] - Elk Jarl - Old, but strong and wise. Comes off as a little dim, but is well loved and always puts his clan first. He's old, and looking for someone worthy to pass the torch. He struggles with memory, and often confuses you for his Son, ???.
	- His last raid was of a Boar Clan harbor that was known for having a large non-jotn populaton. They were slaves, and Gunvaldr freed as many as he could, took a noblewoman from Chantalier that wanted to run away. She was a costume and stage designer. They pulled the Boat from the raid to the village and built the long hall around it, upsidedown so the sails are curtains and the rigging can control the stage.
- [[Beinir ]]- Extended Family? Advisor to the Elk Jarl, eccentric, old, and crazy. Prefers the company of the woods and animals to people. Has long suspected you were different, but welcomes you as an Elk all the same. Always trying to persuade you to commune with your ancestors.
- Birth Parents both dead, killed by their Tribe when you were a teenager.
	- mom - Karhjotskin - Bear Clan - Became an incredibly powerful Shaman - loving, warm, sang to you. She would have episodes where she claimed to see the dead, which drove her a bit mad.
	- Dad - Ghosthoof - Hunter that found and cared for and protected mom
### Friends
- Jarl's Niece? - Some sorta Lady? - She keeps the Clan in order when the Jarl needs help, she's matronly, but only for those worth her time. She desperately wants you to impress her, but doesn't care at all about you becoming Jarl (though that would also be impressive). She may see something in you that no one else does, even you.
- Hound - best good boy
### Mentors and Colleagues
- [[Gunvaldr ...]] 
- Shaman
- Which Ancestor do you like the most, and for what reason?
### Rivals and Enemies
- Boar Raider? - A formidable warrior you've known since you were young. Brave and reliable, but incredibly callous and unforgiving. Knows your goals and doesn't think you're ready yet, but still begrudgingly likes you. Jarl keeps him close because he never trusted his father, sends you on most raids with him.
- The Boar Clan has long been antagonistic to the Elk Clan, but there has been a tenuous, long-standing peace since the Elk Clan stopped its expansion into the Witchwood of the South
- The Ghosthoof Tribe that killed your Parents... 
- Though you know little of the Imperium, what you have heard might upset and disturb you. You also know that the Boar Clan has been working for them, meaning they could've forsaken their Spirit entirely
