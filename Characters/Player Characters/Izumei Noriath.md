### Expression
Presents mostly feminine - Keeping clothing and styling relatively androgynous and plain.
- Typical Attire - Darker neutral tones, cloak for obscuring face, comfortable functional, layered Ha-Fu(?) style robes styled for mobility.
- Scholarly stuff - 
- Formal - Traditional Elven attire mostly guided by House representation rather than individual expression. Scroll adornments
- Personal Adornment - Lots of detailed accessories that are easy to overlook, but very intentionally chosen from beloved jewelry, found treasures, and specialized/customized materials.
## Personality
- Emphatically Curious, but a bit Naive - Your thirst for knowledge is unquenchable, especially in matters of experiencing others' cultures. This enthusiasm is endearing, but it could also be easily taken advantage of. You are overly trusting of power structures, and a bit sheltered.
- Shy about yourself, but Charming in your element - When eyes are on you, sometimes it feels like people see something you don't. You wonder if they  know/like who you really are or who you are expected to be. Your practiced public demeanor suits you well enough, but when speaking on matters of your expertise, you can light up a room.
- Uncertain, but Optimistic - After living most of your life at the whims of other people, you're still finding out who you are when you're living for yourself. However, you think you're on the right path, and the future seems bright, if a little perilous.
- Quirks
- Shames
- Prides
### Hobbies
- Reading
- Urban Exploring
- Birds
### Likes
- Traveling?
- Trying new food
- Local culture/community
- Talking to the elderly about old stuff
### Dislikes
- Liars
## Backstory
Who were you before becoming an Adventurer?
### Childhood
- Privileged and carefree, was not looked after closely and didn't quite fit in.
- Liked to sneak into the lower city and find old stuff, met ZB doing so, and became much more interested in the lower city than the court
- Got caught/saved and was publicly admonished, so started taking school more seriously, and sneaking MUCH more seriously
### Coming of Age
Finding the Archives and being accepted as Archscribe's Assistant. You were still quite young at this time but you first felt a sense of your own agency and purpose.
### Adulthood
- You live in the shadow of your older, more accomplished sibling, which works well for both of you. However, you still do not feel completely at home.
- You work for the Archscribe in the Archives, which you truly enjoy and are good at.
- You don't have high aspirations, which you would be comfortable with if it didn't require managing the expectations of your family, patron, and the Court at large.
#### Successes
- Accepted into the leadership track of the divinatory school, despite not really seeing it as a success?
- Found multiple ancient relics, some returned?, most archived
#### Struggles
- Court life is tedious
- Very few people seem to truly understand you
- Wants Fwends
#### Lifestyle
- Enjoys the finer things and was pampered as a noble.
- Can rough-it and camp if needed, but would prefer to do so in as much comfort as can be afforded. 
## Social
### Family
- Your family, House Noriath, is a lesser house in service to [[House Inoriel]], the monastery of the Diviners. Their responsibilities are to help tend to the Aerie and ensure that the Star Council's messages are sent swiftly and securely, but are also some of the finest quill makers in the world. This has historically significant in ages past, but now is somewhat vestigial, but a self sustaining partnership.
- [[Aravir Shi Noriath]] - Dad is basically a kiss-ass to [[Imanor Kain Inoriel]] and is a prominent cleric, and Quillmaster, a mostly symbolic position that he nonetheless performs with pride and enthusiasm. A master Craftsman, good father by [[Meiyun]] standards, and an even better servant to [[Azurieth]].
- [[Minathil Shi Noriath]] - Mom is a bit of a recluse and enigma. She spends most of her time with the birds of the aerie and takes her responsibility as Birdmaster very seriously. Though emotionally distant, she was one of your greatest enablers when it came to your young exploits.
- [[Lihari Kyun Inoriel]] - Your an older sibling, a model student, child, and member of Elven society. You live in their shadow, but this works better for both of you. They can complain about their woes of the court without scandal, and you are able to avoid the court's overbearing scrutiny. Probably not much of rival except when they get the positive attention that you actually do want instead of you.
### Friends
- [[Rowan Tanoril]] childhood friend
- [[Natsu Ko Ryonelde]] - Kid with broken sword from childhood. Guy from [[Elthieru]] Nobility, here to train with the city guard and join [[House Ryonelde]]. He is considered Princely by other Azurieth nobility, but seems strange and foreign, neither Meiyun or Naelun. He helps with urban exploration by foiling the Guards' attempts to find you. He's kinda taken the place of ZB's character in his absence.
- The Owl - new fren
### Mentors and Colleagues
- [[Noralin Kain Azurieth]] - Archscribe - One of the oldest Elves ever, a close friend of [[Arasune Tsun Azurieth|Divine Empress Arasune]] and also Archscribe to the previous Empress. You are her apprentice and she is exceedingly patient with you, but also has extremely high expectations of you and is far too old to deal with people or things that frustrate her. She understands you better than most, and is genuinely happy to share the Archives with you, but she also needs you to understand the importance of your duty. She also shares her unique relationship with Inoriel and your house, but understands and respects your more pragmatic upbringing. Will you nominate Lihari to replace you while on your adventure? 
- [[Imanor Kain Inoriel]] - Patron of [[House Inoriel]] - He is a natural father figure, stern, serious, but with a calming presence. Definitely likes your sibling more than you, but also appreciates your presence and sees potential in you. He wishes you were more ambitious, and becomes quite interested in you after your Awakening.
### Rivals and Enemies
- [[Lord Bertrand Pensworth]] - Gnome/Dwarf - Master of the Guild of Wonders, an Archeological institution that locates, transports, and either auctions or archives/protects ancient artifacts. Think Milo from Atlantis. He has been seeking an audience with you on many occasions, but you have either snubbed him, been otherwise busy, or just have not been interested. 
- [[Vireth Shi Ryonelde]] - Guardmaster trying to thwart your urban exploration? Kind of a Aladdin head guard thing going on, but not at all a bad guy. Vexed by the disparity of what is considered crime in the court vs. the lower city. You in particular complicate things because you are somewhat important and putting yourself in real danger.
- Graverobbers, Treasure hunters, people who would misappropriate lost knowledge.
- Possible political opponents that did not interest you?
