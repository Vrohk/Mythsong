## Backstory

- Recruited into a spelltech program after being visited by a friend of Father.
### Coming of Age
When did you consider yourself an Adult? How did it change you?
- 
### Adulthood
What lead you to your Adventure?
- Excelled in the Spelltech program, specializing in weaponsmithing. Lived in Dawnhaven and quite liked the Imperium.
#### Successes
What were some victories along the way?
- 
#### Struggles

- Death of Father
- abandoned Mother
- adversity as a half-elf
- difficulty socializing
#### Lifestyle
How do you live, and what sort of luxuries can you not live without?
- Modest in early life, rigid structure and well taken care of in adolescence. Finds the finer things in life tedious and frivolous, but may enjoy them despite yourself.
## Social
Who did you know in your life before your Adventure?
### Family
Who did you grow up around? How/did you adopt their values?
- [[Ilaryon Tanoril]] - Dad - mechanic/clockmaker, helped mentor, but was cold and dispassionate. Looks at you as kind of a bastard, killed by a gun when you're young. 
- [[Daelyth Tanoril]] - You're closer with her and because of this sympathize with non-elves in the Capital. She was a model mother when you were younger, and was tirelessly supportive of both you and your dad. Had a soft spot for [[Izumei Noriath]], and liked when she would visit.
	- You keep in touch, though carefully and sparingly using the birds of Amy's Aerie. But you haven't gotten a response in a long time
- [[Dr. Ogbert Slate]] - Master of the Artificer's Guild and brilliant scientist from the Frontier. Former member of the Weaponsmith's Guild that left after ethical differences regarding the potential for magical weaponry. Ogbert, while distant and a bit cold, definitely has an eye for talent and likes and respects you. Adopting you was a panicked decision that you respect him for, not resent him for. In his youth, he worked on [[Lady Brynna Halfhill]]'s early projects that lead to the breakthroughs in combustion and locomotion. This is a point of pride for him, but he also feels terrible guilt about it, connecting it directly to the conflict that led to him leaving the Weaponsmith's Guild and creating his own. He's made a comfortable life for himself and his pupil in the Imperium, but has grown justifiably paranoid in recent years. He plans on courting the Elven Empress to relocate to Azurieth. 
### Friends
Who did you choose to spend your time with?
- [[Izumei Noriath]] - childhood friend... Probably the only one
- [[Natsu Ko Ryonelde]] - City Guard you met in childhood, friendly but never got to know him well. If Izumei trusts him, he's probably cool.
### Colleagues or Mentors
Did you know anyone professionally? 
- [[Dr. Ogbert Slate]]
- [[Lady Brynna Halfhill]] - an engineer of legend that disappeared after her inventions catapulted the world into the industrial era, leading to the conflict between the Sovereignty and Imperium.
### Rivals or Enemies
Who would be your old competition or who has wronged you/been wronged by you?
- [[Dr. Itzel Kualli]] - Jungle Cat Vanaqi - Was adopted very young by Slate, and lived most of her life in the Imperium. Gifted medical doctor, idealistic, direct, capable, and quite sassy. Being from the Jungle of Fangs and raised around the Vanaqi, she is not accustomed to men being afforded so much social and economic freedom, which she still finds quaint. Had she not met a man as brilliant as Slate, she may not have ever her homeland; but man or not, Slate saw the same future she did.
