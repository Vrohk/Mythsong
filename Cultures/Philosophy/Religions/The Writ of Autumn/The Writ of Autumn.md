**Basic Knowledge and Modern History**

If meant literally:
> "I wander only where I will,
> I stay only if I'm welcome,
> I ask for only what I need,
> I offer only what I can spare,
> and I leave only when I've kept my word."
> - The Writ of Autumn

Generally, The Writ of Autumn refers to an ancient set of religious practices originating in [[Aubervale]]. The mentality of these practices is to neither be ashamed to nor shun those that ask for help. 

Followers of the Writ of Autumn are generally either called [[The Strangers]], who are the humble 'Wanderers', and [[The Hearths]], who are the ones that offer sanctuary.

**Taverns**
Taverns in ancient Human culture were considered places of sanctuary and the beating heart of any community. Many older Human settlements still practice this tradition, and their town hall, theatre, tavern, and inn, all are one communal structure - effectively this religions' church.

**Archways**
Thresholds hold significance to those that follow the Writ, specifically stone archways. Carved into the stone entrances to many Inns in the [[Old Kingdoms]] you can find "The Host's Response", which is offered in response back and forth when invoking the Writ of Autumn.

**The Host's Response**
>"I welcome those who wander,
>I offer food and shelter,
>I ask for only gratitude,
>I accept your service if you offer,
>and I'll honor your word if you honor my welcome."
>- The Host's Response

However, if practiced traditionally, these sayings actually are a sort of contract or agreement. A Wanderer can ask for welcome at any Hearth, but a Hearth can ask for something in exchange, accepting service in lieu of payment or trade. If agreed upon, the Guest may leave only if they have either fulfilled the agreement or do not Honor the Welcome.

One of the more superstitious beliefs held by [[Humans]] of the [[Old Kingdoms]]...

>I plea for sanctum, I beg for
