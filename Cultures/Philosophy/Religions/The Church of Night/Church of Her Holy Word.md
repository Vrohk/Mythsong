**Basic Info and Modern History**

**Tenants**
We are flawed, and therefore sin
We are faithful, and therefore can be redeemed

**Knight Wardens**
Warrior Nobles of the [[Old Kingdoms]], typically personal guards of pious royalty. Members of the Church can be chosen for Knighthood. First, they must complete The Trial of Roses, then, if sanctified by both Human Royalty and a Bishop, they become a Knight Warden. Famously, the [[Hero of Dorramere]] was a Knight Warden, but since the War the order has become more of ceremonial title. 

**The Trial of Roses**
> [[The Maiden of Evening]] accepts her favor of Roses if you can overcome the Thorns of your Vices. She asks you to sow the seeds of Mercy, 
> [[The Dusk Shepherd]] will light her Lantern and show you the path if you do not stray from your Duty.
> The Maiden then will unlock the door to your fate.
> Beyond the door is your grave, and you must overcome your Pride and dance with Death.
> 
> Only then can you reap the harvest of Honor.

The Maiden's Favor, the evening's call,
her words are roses, my vices are thorns,
Sow the seeds of Mercy, 

Light your lantern, show the path,
Reap the harvest, do not stray,
The night will end, but death will not.

**Expressions**
[Shepherd take Me]

"I see your Virtue." - An expression of gratitude.
"I know your Virtue..." - An expression of gratitude but also a presumed conversation or offer of Confession.

Clerics of the Church of Night often will offer their blessings unbidden to those that help them, or any who display virtue while in their presence. 

[[Humility]] before the dead,
[[Temperance]] 
[[Duty]] to the night,
[[Mercy]]
[[Honor]]

**Structure**
Chapel of Dusk
A place of worship, generally in Cemeteries, or villages too small for their own church. Sometimes merely an alcove in a stable, well, or another public structure.

Sancti Noctem
A larger Chapel, but one that can serve as a place for Confession, rather than just personal worship. The subject of many superstitions and featured prominently in [[Tales of the Witchwood]].

House of the Evening
A place where followers can seek refuge, Confession, hear a normal nightly sermon, or receive Absolution if a Confessor is present.

Cathedral of Night
A Church built on Hallowed ground where followers can receive Absolution. These serve all of the same functions of a House of Evening, but also are offices and bases of operations for the Church. Normally have sprawling crypt networks beneath.

**Members**
**[[Silent Keeper]]**
Volunteers to the church that help with care or manual labor, especially when it comes to building and maintaining the many graveyards and cemeteries of the [[Old Kingdoms]]. Anyone willing is put to work and offered a place to stay and food to eat if the Church can spare it.

**Cleric**
Clerics of the Church of Night are normally heads of a Chapel or Sanctum, but smaller ones only require a single Cleric. Larger Churches or Cathedrals employ many Clerics, though their responsibilities vary widely. Although Clerics can hear Confessions, they cannot offer Absolution.

**Confessor**
The head of the church in a settlement. Confessors can offer Absolution, though this is typically a personal process that requires an established relationship with a worshipper.

**Bishop**
The head of the church in a Kingdom.
