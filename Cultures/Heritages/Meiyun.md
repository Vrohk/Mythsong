## **Basic Knowledge**

Considering themselves connected by blood or service to the ancient ruling class of [[Elves]] called [[Star Council]] and the [[Divine Empress]], what remains of the [[Meiyun]] are typically proud, traditional, and sensitive to [[Magic]]. Others may see them as a bit soft and pretentious, but unmistakably refined, well spoken, and often respected. The [[Meiyun]] of [[Xiaothiel]] are a bit more worldly, pragmatic, and industrious than their Capital born counterparts.

### **Recent History**

In the years following the [[War of Black Sun]], the devastation wrought upon the [[Elven Dynasty]] virtually destroyed the [[Meiyun]] way of life. The old system of governance was essentially gone, and what little remained was split between restoring the Dynasty and creating [[The Imperium]]. After displaced leadership assumed a joint control of the High Houses of Nobility, and essentially recreated the [[Star Council]]. 

During this arduous reconstruction period, the Capital's population dwindled so much so that in order to keep the city running [[Empress X]] sold much of the wealth of the throne which she famously denied granting to the young Imperium.

After the re-founding of the [[Academy Arcana]], a tenuous prosperity flourished in the Capital and the traditions of the [[Meiyun]] had a resurgence.

## **Culture**

### Language
How do they name things and communicate with writing or speech?
#### Naming Conventions
Name, honorific, Surname, "of" Family Name

Surnames are usually reserved for the House you serve, rather than the Family you were born into. Houses are not always also families, they are more like institutions families become parts of if their goals of study and artisanship align.

If your House or Title is irrelevant, Elves normally just use Name or Family Name. In closer relationships, it's not uncommon to use titles or names interchangeably or a mix of multiple names in one.

Honorifics - Used mostly within the Court, Guard, and Star Council
- Ko/Kon - Student 
- Kyu/Kyun - Senior - Technically Slang, but widely adopted and mostly used affectionately among students and apprentices, but also to acknowledge a Student's progress
- Mei/Min - Apprentice - 
- So/Son? - Expert - Not a Teacher, but someone with considerable skill who is no longer an Apprentice, but not yet a Master. A common default meant to offer respect when a more accurate title is not known.
- Se/Sen - Teacher
- Shi/Shin - Master
- Kai/Kain - Council

- Tsu/Tsun - Empress

**Food / Agriculture**
[[Commoner]]
[[Meiyun]] Commoners are mostly servants, merchants, or tenders of gardens and farmland. Most commoners would live either in [[Xiaothiel]] or the Lower City districts of [[Azurieth]] or one of the nearby fishing or farming villages. Although poverty is rife in the ruins of the old Capital, most commoners in these regions live relatively well so long as you have a skill in demand or land to farm.
Resources: Fish, Bamboo, Rice, Peppers, Silkworm

**Art / Language**
Though Art for Art's sake is not very popular in [[Meiyun]] culture, the Elves make and do everything with their own flair. Crafters are not considered worthy unless their crafted goods are both functional as well as aesthetic. This mentality extends to public works, civil engineering, and architecture, even with the extensive restoration that occurred after the War.
Music, theatre, and live performances of all kinds are the most common forms of
Elven Language and writing revolve heavily around scrolls, and the practiced, perfect execution of their calligraphy. 

**Family Life / Society**
Elves are generally pragmatic when it comes to child raising and are rather hands-off. When childhood is such a small part of your long life, not much importance is placed on individually attending to each child. Instead, fostering curiosity and having the resources available for anyone to learn a skill is placed at the forefront of Society.
Parents and Children typically remain together, but it is not uncommon or strange to leave your family for opportunity to follow your area of expertise. [[Meiyun]] are often considered cold or distant by others who share more traditional family structures. 

[[Trade]]
[[Meiyun]] are known for the devotion, care, and meticulous nature of their servants and artisans. To them, nothing is worth doing poorly, and great pride is taken in the mastery of your chosen trade. [[Meiyun]] are popular for their taste in exquisite fabrics, intricately metal worked jewelry, scrolls/paper, and discreet personal servants.
Professions: Tailors, Jewelers, Scribes, Courtesans, Tutors
Imports: 
Exports: Silks, Clothing, Fabrics, Cloth Armor, Jewelry, Scrolls, Paper, Rice

[[Religious]]
While the [[Meiyun]] are not typically religious, most do follow certain religious practices regarding the [[Divine Empress]], timekeeping, and the movement of the stars and moon. The [[Star Council]] and those devoted to the preservation of the Council's objective or serving the [[Divine Empress]] directly consider their duties a divine calling. Each of the [[Academy Arcana]] also have a [[Constellar Deities]], which represents the ideals of their teachings and are often worshipped through the lesson and lecture.

[[Noble]]
[[Meiyun]] Nobility derives from service to the [[Divine Empress]], the [[Star Council]], or one of it's several [[Academy Arcana]]. While strong familial ties are common, it is not specific to blood or name. Meiyun Nobles value knowledge above all else, so many scholars are offered nobility based purely on research or educational merits. In [[Xiaothiel]], the ancient Meiyun Noble house of [[Thaelryu]] rules the Kingdom alongside the [[Thaelryu Council]] and those that are part of either or high-ranking public servants are considered Noble.

[[Military]]
The Meiyun have little to speak of in terms of a traditional military save for the City Guard of [[Azurieth]] or [[Thaelryu]], both of which are often also considered Noble. Some Nobility may host or train their own [[Windblessed]] Warriors of the [[Naelun (Ungifted)]] tradition, but this is typically considered extravagant. Outside Guard duty, most people with Military Backgrounds in this Heritage will likely not have seen combat unless they participated in the [[Thaelryu Revolt]], and attempted coup of the Noble House in [[Xiaothiel]] that the [[Divine Empress]] controversially helped thwart 10 years ago.
