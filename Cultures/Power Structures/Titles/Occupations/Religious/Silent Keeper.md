Volunteers to the [[Church of Her Holy Word]] that help with care or manual labor, especially when it comes to building and maintaining the many graveyards and cemeteries of the [[Old Kingdoms]]. Silent Keepers can be identified by their black cloaks and white veils, nearly always in a pair, and are often thought to be deaf, mute, or blind.
