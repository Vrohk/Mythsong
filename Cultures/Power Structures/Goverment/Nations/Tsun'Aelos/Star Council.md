# [[Star Council]] 

The [[Star Council]] is a group of [[Ruler|Rulers]] of the [[New Elven Dynasty]], which assembles in the [[High Forum]] of [[Azurieth]]. It is sort of academic Parliament comprised of head Scholars appointed by each of the [[Academy Arcana]], and a chosen government appointed by the [[Divine Empress]].

## **Basic Knowledge**

A organization comprised of the head Scholars from each of the [[Academy Arcana]] and experts of each of their fields appointed by and loyal to the [[Divine Empress]]. 

In the old days before the [[War of Black Sun]], these schools were more like churches, following the teachings of one of the [[Constellar Deities]] and worshipping the [[Divine Empress]] as their Goddess. However, after the [[War of Black Sun]], these churches saw waning popularity as the Elves regrouped and rebuilt their ruined lands.

## **Details and Systems**

Subject Matter Experts can be appointed by the Empress with a majority approval of the [[Star Council]]. Each are meant to act as a check and balance for one another, with the head Scholars prioritizing educational rigor and value, and the Experts focusing on implementation and benefits to the Kingdom.
