# Vanaqi
## Xoq'etzi
- Inspired from Bronze age
- Maybe early druids unveiled huge amounts of bronze when they were laying the foundations of the city
- this was mostly used as a status symbol, but as it became oxidized and lost its color, it was thought to represent ???
	- Some form of corruption?
- a Druidic pilgrimage of the Dwarves to the Vanaqi
	- ancient tradition based on a decree of Tol'zelle to always honor those under the earth
	- this manifested into a general love of small burrowing creatures
	- Xoq'etzi is larger underground, though the tunnels have been sealed for millennia
- Vanaqi trade bronze and all manner of plants to the Dwarves
- Dwarves trade a incredibly pure and powerful magical soil

# Jotn

	- Herds of Elk, Reindeer, and Moose are being slaughtered at established and protected migratory crossings
