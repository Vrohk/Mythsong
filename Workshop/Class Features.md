# Artificer - 5e

Most subspecs are accounted for, but not 
### Level 2: Infuse Item

_2nd-level artificer feature_

You've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

#### Infusions Known

When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the "[Artificer Infusions](https://5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html#blankhash,flstfeature%20type:ai=1,flstsource:tce=1)" section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

#### Artificer Infusions

Artificers have invented numerous magical infusions, extraordinary processes that rapidly create magic items. To many, artificers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.

The description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.

Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.

#### Infusing an Item

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see "[Attunement](https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,attunement,0)" in chapter 7 of the [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG)).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a [bag of holding](https://5e.tools/items.html#bag%20of%20holding_dmg), its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### Level 3: The Right Tool for the Job

_3rd-level artificer feature_

You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with [thieves' tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#thieves'%20tools_phb) or [artisan's tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#artisan's%20tools_phb) in hand, you can magically create one set of [artisan's tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#artisan's%20tools_phb) in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

### Level 7: Flash of Genius

_7th-level artificer feature_

INTELLECT FEAT?

You've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 10: Magic Item Adept

_10th-level artificer feature_

You've achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

- You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
- If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

### Level 11: Spell-Storing Item

_11th-level artificer feature_

Upgraded Runic Spellstone?

You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one [simple or martial weapon](https://5e.tools/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:phb=1,flstcategory:basic=1,flsttype:martial%20weapon=1~simple%20weapon=1) or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the [artificer spell list](https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:artificer=1,flstcast%20time:action=1,flstlevel:1=1~2=1) that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires [concentration](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#concentration_phb), the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

### Level 14: Magic Item Savant

_14th-level artificer feature_

Your skill with magic items deepens:

- You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
- You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

### Level 20: Soul of Artifice

_20th-level artificer feature_

You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

- You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
- If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

### Level 3: Experimental Elixir

_Alchemist Artificer_

Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an _experimental elixir_ in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an [incapacitated](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#incapacitated_phb) creature.

Creating an _experimental elixir_ requires you to have [alchemist's supplies](https://5e.tools/items.html#alchemist's%20supplies_phb) on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.

You can create additional _experimental elixirs_ by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table.

Experimental Elixir

|d6|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|**Healing**. The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier.|
|2|**Swiftness**. The drinker's walking speed increases by 10 feet for 1 hour.|
|3|**Resilience**. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes.|
|4|**Boldness**. The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute.|
|5|**Flight**. The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes.|
|6|**Transformation**. The drinker's body is transformed as if by the [alter self](https://5e.tools/spells.html#alter%20self_phb) spell. The drinker determines the transformation caused by the spell, the effects of which last for 10 minutes.|
### Level 9: Restorative Reagents

Starting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:

- Whenever a creature drinks an _experimental elixir_ you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
- You can cast [lesser restoration](https://5e.tools/spells.html#lesser%20restoration_phb) without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use [alchemist's supplies](https://5e.tools/items.html#alchemist's%20supplies_phb) as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### Level 15: Chemical Mastery

By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:

- You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are immune to the [poisoned](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#poisoned_phb) condition.
- You can cast [greater restoration](https://5e.tools/spells.html#greater%20restoration_phb) and [heal](https://5e.tools/spells.html#heal_phb) without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use [alchemist's supplies](https://5e.tools/items.html#alchemist's%20supplies_phb) as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

### Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have [Advantage](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#advantage_xphb) on [Initiative](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#initiative_xphb) rolls.
### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the [Bonus Action](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#bonus%20action_xphb) you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your [Speed](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#speed_xphb).

### Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any [Advantage](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#advantage_xphb) on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have [Disadvantage](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#disadvantage_xphb). If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or [Unarmed Strike](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#unarmed%20strike_xphb), and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

***Forceful Blow.*** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your [Speed](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#speed_xphb) straight toward the target without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](https://5e.tools/actions.html#opportunity%20attack_xphb).

***Hamstring Blow.*** The target's [Speed](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#speed_xphb) is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one.

***Staggering Blow.*** The target has [Disadvantage](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#disadvantage_xphb) on the next saving throw it makes, and it can't make [Opportunity Attacks](https://5e.tools/actions.html#opportunity%20attack_xphb) until the start of your next turn.

***Sundering Blow.*** Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.
