## Profession Module
Mostly for world content, re-engaging with familiar parts of the world, and re-playable stuff for casual players to do... 
### Gathering
Exploration and Vehicle based gameplay. Finding hidden areas with rich resource nodes, jumping puzzles to find super rare resources, and timed(?) buffs to promote finding fast, efficient, or lucrative routes from resource to resource.
- First time gathers always yield max bonus Skill Exp and resources.
- Repeat gathers offer a chance to complete a mini game like Fruit Ninja, or another quick, super-simple mobile/warioware style game.
- Playing the mini-game gives bonus Exp and Resources, but you can opt to skip it if you want.
- As Resources are gathered from an Area, it will affect the Ecology, preventing that Resource from being found as often, and increasing the rate the other Resources can be found.
	- ie: If all of a certain herb is picked, prey animals will stop spawning and prevent the gathering of their hides...
### Refining
Addicting puzzle style mobile gameplay. Casual players feed the industry of the NPC markets, demands, and gathering bounties.
- Match-3, Downwell, Infinirunner, Vampire Survivors, endless/ endurance/ survival mobile style game.
- The longer you go the more bonus exp and Resources... To a point, then it levels off to give only an incremental increase.
- New Resources are new puzzles/levels, and are more like benchmarks.
- Afterwards, you can skip the refining minigame...
### Crafting
Crafting is a lot more involved depending on the skill, but should feel like solving a rewarding puzzle.
- Quest involved for Blueprints?
- Blueprints are the test, once the test is passed crafting no longer requires the mini game until high level
- This should be fueled by endgame and heavily PoE inspired
- Powerful items require bound offerings from difficult content, and are consumed during the crafting process, but the crafter must be tested and pass

## Orcs
Considered having women unable to give vaginal birth, so they must carve their young out of their own bodies. This highly ritualized in Mor'Amon-Ra, as if every birth is a potential sacrifice of the mother.
- Scarification?
- How does this tie in to their reincarnation myths?
- Population decline - How is this explained, is it understood by others?
- Rogue inspired midwives? Locate expecting mothers, bring them to the capital if possible, help with the procedure if not.
