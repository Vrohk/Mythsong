## Specialization
How do your gifts manifest?

### [[Awakening]]
The moment you suddenly were aware of your Magical Gift. Most people that have Awoken have an overpowering transformative experience or are suddenly able to access their Power when faced with a life changing/threatening situation. This could manifest as casting your first Spell, or communing with a Deity the first time, etc.
- A 1st Level Adventurer does not necessarily need to have Awoken to be a Playable Character. In fact I may change 1st and 2nd Level to be Training only, and 3rd Level to be Specialization and Awakening
	- Keep in mind - Beyond 3rd Level, you're basically superhuman. Harnessing this potential is a form of Awakening, even if it's purely increasing your physical, mental, or martial prowess.
- How and when did this happen?
- Who knows about your Awakening? Was there any witnesses?
