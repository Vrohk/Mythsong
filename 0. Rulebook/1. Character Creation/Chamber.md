A small, half-elven woman, mutilated in earlier life by...? Now she is part experimental weapon, part assassin, but also a deeply troubled person in need of love and trust. Behaves kind of like a stray cat, but is mostly loyal to her handler, the Guildmaster of Armaments.

Dark, dark red hair, almost black. She wears it straight and down most of the time so she can hide her golden brown/red human eyes. She clipped her ears, and they are heavily pierced. She wears dark eye make up and seems to cry a lot but that might be an aesthetic choice. Her skin is a pale, pale, cool white that has a very slight opalescence in the right light. Most of her left arm is missing, and has been replaced by clockwork artifice that conceals a powerful cannon. 

Wears tight leather vest and pants with revealing side stitching, a flowy shirt beneath that leaves shoulders exposed, and lacey undergarments that she makes no attempt at hiding. Her demeanor is intense, passionate, but nervous and flighty.
