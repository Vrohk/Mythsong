- Forgotten, the land is indifferent - Trees, clouds, and spirits hang low here...
- Gothic, Death is ever-present - The human kingdoms are a monument to their inextricable connection to it. The land itself seems to protest the existence of the Humans, but with nowhere else to go, they gratefully tend to what little they have.
- Bleak, but not without hope -  No matter what befalls them, the Humans seem to be able to lean on one another to persevere like a flickering candle in the dark.
