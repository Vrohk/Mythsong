# Setting

[[Dorramere]] - a narrow country with a long coastline that spans the moors and swamps of the Witchwood bordering the Jotn's homelands to the north, and the thick forests of Aubervale to the South. It is an old land that the world forgot for entire eras, the edge of an old mountain range that has long since ground into the waves, the edge of a large lake that slowly ebbs back and forth into the ocean. Winters are long here, but autumns and shadows are longer. It is a cold and misty place, inhospitable to most, but the Humans never had a chance to find a better place to call their own.
While those from [[Aubervale]] might disagree, [[Dorramere]] is considered by most to be the oldest of the Human's kingdoms and their ancestral homelands. It's Capital, [[Erithorne]], once the shining jewel of the Human civilization, is still home to King and Queen of [[House Ashgrave]] who have ruled since before the [[War of Black Sun]]. Although the Hero of Legend was too an Ashgrave, the inception of the Imperium left the mostly intact country of [[Dorramere]] to atrophy and decay. The void left by ambitious Noble houses gave way to cities struggling to maintain power and govern themselves. The Guilds saw opportunity, and were quick to sponsor the reconstruction of areas with any resources. The [[Church of Her Holy Word]] still clings to the last vestiges of Nobility, trying to offer hope, stability, and some sense of pride in Human tradition. Even the Knight Wardens have all but disappeared, Clerics of Her Holy Word have received the order to  roam the lands to protect the common folk from the terrors that now haunts the woods and swamps unchallenged. 
Now, crown's pride and joy, [[Princess Isolde Ashgrave]], has gone missing. Nobility suspects a kidnapping and potential coup, and in their paranoia, King and Queen Ashgrave have closed Erithorne's gates rumors stir that they mean to call their banners to war... 

You travel through old and dark woods dotted with crumbled rocky hills and clearing of fetid swamps. The pines and firs seem to buckle under the weight of their growing shadows. The jagged skeletons of trees only half awake from winter sway and claw lazily at the last hints of light in a sky drowned in low hanging clouds. Mist and fog creep across the soft, mossy ground of the surrounding moors. You smell the sweetness of rot on the forest floor, and the coldness of a breeze carrying the scent of rain. You hear the soft tapping of an anemic droplets filling puddles that dot the gutters and road. The cold and damp in this place seem like the type to never completely be warmed or dried away.

In the distance, you see [[Grimsby]], a modest Human Village at the edge of the [[Witchwood]]. A collection of crooked, wooden and brick buildings crowded around the crossroads of this ancient Dwarven road. The lanterns of street corners are already lit, and the flames seem to sputter and waver in protest of the coming night.

Even this early in the evening, many of the houses and buildings here seem suspiciously devoid of light or life. Villagers hiding under cloaks nervously glance back at you before hurrying on their way, clutching their belongs to their chest tightly. Trudging across the muddy cobblestones, you pass a large plot, lined by wrought iron spiked fencing dotted with rust and moss. Within you see a network of meticulously maintain brick pathways dotted with dozens upon dozens of modest graves. In the center, a Chapel of Dusk with its stark white archways, steeped belltower, and faintly illuminated stained glass windows. Its doors are opened and a Silent Keeper stands veiled outside, holding her lantern in welcome to those that would wish  another goodnight to those they have lost.

Passing the town square, it's easy to tell where the Humans laid the first stones of this town, hoping that this Dwarven road would bring them security and prosperity. A large stone well still dominates the crossroads, covered by old mossy timber roofs. Crossing the square you finally reach the Tavern, a marvel of architecture by comparison to the other structures around. It hasn't seemed to sink too much into the mud, and instead has a foundation of smooth, large, stones that stack smaller and smaller into a large stone archway, carved with an old language you don't recognize. Within the arch are a set of large, heavy, wooden doors with wrought iron knockers. The rest of the tavern looks comparatively modern and plain, but made of timber, and without the strange crooked slant shared amongst the other buildings. It looms over the entryway, covering the comparatively dry stone stoop. The windows, while relatively foggy, still glow with a welcoming warmth and light...

Inside, you are transported away from the bleak cold approaching rain... You are greeted immediately by a large, open, hearth who's cornerstones stretch upward into arches that support a large chimney. To one side of the Hearth there's an open cloak room, where you can sit to remove and dry your boots and cloaks. To the other side, an entryway leads into the Tavern proper. In the Hearth hangs a number of bundles of herbs, freshly drying and releasing a sweet and spicy mix of rosemary, cloves, and ...? A cauldron bubbles slowly, filled with a savory and hearty stew of carrots, potatoes, and a rich brown gravy.

A long bar of a single gigantic split log stretches from one end of the Tavern to the other, curtained doors on either side, with a small window between to slide food out of the Kitchen. A number of torches hang from sconces placed on large round wooden pillars that support the balconies of the upper levels. In the center, 2 enormous long tables dominate much of the smooth flat stone floor, with the hearth on one end, and a small elevated stage at the other. Opposite the bar, and across the center tables, there are a number of smaller private booths with inviting deep brown wooden alcoves, covered with rich, blue-green velvet curtains, tied back with small bronze bells. Above, you can see 2 levels of balconies, with small tables and chairs that can look down to the stage on the ground floor.

A large, human man stands behind the bar, wiping down mugs before placing them on a shelf behind him. You think he's trying to smile at you? He has a broad nose and wide jaw, with dark, medium length hair combed back, sporting an impressive pair of mutton chops, and the bristl-iest mustache you've ever seen.
