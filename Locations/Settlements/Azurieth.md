## **Details and Systems**
### **Map
Leaflet map with basic locations

#### Sub-Locations
- [[The Barrier Hills]] - A war-torn, crumbling region of the Lower City left in disrepair after several high houses left the Capital to help build the Imperium.
- [[Moonbridge]] - The main thoroughfare and trade region, connecting the entrance of the Capital in the Barrier Hills to the High Forum.
- [[High Forum]] - An immense round structure where the Star Council convenes. 1 half is a large courtyard where the public gathers for announcements and to have their voices heard by the rulers. The other half is the internal chamber where most of the actual governing takes place. At its center there is a large Astrolabe, made from ancient artifice and now restored to its original glory. At its center is the Empress' throne, and rotating around it (slowly) are the platforms of the 8 high houses.
- [[Nightdocks]] - District of the lower city that boarders the Bay of Stars' Light and the Barrier Hills. 
- [[Terrace Hills]] - Round Terraces overlapping each other to make the stages of a crescent moon, winding up the side of the northern hills to the Upper City and High Forum. Comprised of noble dwellings and elaborate gardens and winding pathways.
- [[Rivermouth]] - Large dam and lake that feeds into the bay. Village on the far side of the dam is the city's outer limits. The river snakes into the hills where much of the Capital's food comes from.
