# **[[Deity]]**

A [[Deity]] is a [[Consciousness]] of pure [[Divinity]], created and controlled by the collected belief of an ideal. Deities are equal parts a creature and a concept, exhibiting the personality of a sapient creature, but who's sole motivation is the embodiment of the belief which gave them life. Deities exist in the Divine Plane of the [[The Luminous Expanse]], where they survey their followers and the landscape of belief that they must govern and expand. The political landscape of the Gods is a constant vie for power, with the rulers becoming one of [[The Truths]], a perfect manifestation of an ideal.
