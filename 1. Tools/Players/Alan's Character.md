-  Social
	- Family
		- [[Elgjarskin]] - Elk Clan - Family and Clan are largely interchangeable for most Jotn in the North.
		- [[Gunvaldr ...]] - Elk Jarl - Old, but strong and wise. Comes off as a little dim, but is well loved and always puts his clan first. He's old, and looking for someone worthy to pass the torch. He struggles with memory, and often confuses you for his Son.
		- Shaman - Extended Family? Advisor to the Elk Jarl, eccentric, old, and crazy. Prefers the company of the woods and animals to people. 
		- Birth Parents both dead, killed by Karhjurskin - Bear Clan - when you were a teenager.
			- mom - Became an incredibly powerful Shaman - loving, warm, sang to you. She would have episodes where she claimed to see the dead, which drove her a bit mad.
			- Dad - Hunter that found and cared for and protected mom
	- Friends
		- Jarl's Niece? - Some sorta Lady? - She keeps the Clan in order when the Jarl needs help, she's matronly, but only for those worth her time. She desperately wants you to impress her, but doesn't care at all about you becoming Jarl (though that would also be impressive). She may see something in you that no one else does, even you.
	- Mentors
		- [[Gunvaldr ...]] 
		- 
		- Which Ancestor do you like the most, and for what reason?
			- The Jarl's favorite was Yonn, a listless Jotn that by all counts should not have been Jarl. When the Trolls invaded in the early days of the last war, Yonn's unorthodox tactics of simply abandoning the village until the forces had moved through Elk lands was surprisingly effective.
			- For this cowardice, he was banished. He then murdered those who conspired against him. Abandoned his weapons, took up a walking stick, and left the village never to return.
			- Why is he my favorite? He knew what was right, he protected the Clan, he stood up for what he believed in, and he accepted the consequences of his actions. He didn't give up, he changed, and his greatest stories at that time had not even been told.
	- Rivals?
		- Boar Raider - A formidable warrior you've known since you were young. Brave and reliable, but incredibly callous and unforgiving. Knows your goals and doesn't think you're ready yet, but still begrudgingly likes you. Jarl keeps him close because he never trusted his father, sends Alan on most raids with him.
	- Enemies
		- The Boar Clan has long been antagonistic to the Elk Clan, but there has been a tenuous, long-standing peace since the Elk Clan stopped its expansion into the Witchwood of the South
		- The Bear Clan that killed your Parents... Vague
		- Though you know little of the Imperium, what you have heard might upset and disturb you. You also know that the Boar Clan has been working for them, meaning they could've forsaken their Spirit entirely
- Personality
	- Gruff, but protective - You try to tell it like it is and cut through the bullshit, but you may come off callous, even when trying to spare those your care about from harm. Sometimes a vaguely hostile presence can prevent a conflict without even lifting a finger.
	- A bit cocky, but all for a good story - A true Jotn would never back down from a chance to prove their worth. Even a hilarious failure can make for a great story, plus a hero must face the risk of failure for their successes to be heroic.
	- Not a smart man, but smart enough to surround himself with smart people - You don't want to sell yourself short, but if you know you're out of your depth, you're not too proud to follow instead of lead.
- Hobbies
	- 
- Childhood
	- Birth parents were of the Bear Clans and the northern wilds, parents were killed in mob violence
	- Kept as slave/punishment, forced to flee into the wilderness
	- Found by Elk Clan Chieftain and taken in as a son. Given a traditional Elk (Wolf) Clan upbringing. More insular than most Clans, but also pretty well adjusted and self sufficient by Jotn standards.
- Adulthood
	- Became proficient hunter - Learned a lot from being Jarl's adopted son.
	- Joined the Raiders to help defend the Clan after an unknown clan hunts the herd until near extinction.
	- Find a logging operation in Wolf Clan territory. Boar Raider is eager to fight, your friend volunteers to be a diplomat... They are hostile after defending against a Troll raid?
	- Groomed for succession to Jarl, but needs to go on a questspringa
- Successes
	- Accepted as the likely successor to the Jarl
	- Participated in successful raid to defend Elk/Wolf territory

- [[Specialization]]
	- 
- [[Awakening]]
	- Not really an Awakening, maybe a psychospiritual connection to Ancestors... Maybe a near-death experience?
	- How - Communing with the Elk Spirit, you are told that Death surrounds the North, and that the ancestral weapon of the Elk Clan must be found and returned. Its last suspected whereabouts were in the hands of a witch in the human homeland. He fears it may now be lost in the tangled web of fate.
