# [[Encounter]]
An [[Event]] where decision making can change the trajectory of the story. Typically these are between two Characters or groups, and may lead to a [[Combat Encounter]] if negotiations fail.


----
## **[[Combat Encounter]]** - Red
This Encounter is intended to result in Combat, and unless the Players have a deliberate and effective plan to avoid it, [[Victory]] likely will require total [[Defeat]] of the Enemy. The Enemies that engage the Players and their Motivations should be planned ahead of time, and only the timing and location of these Encounters should be random.

-------
## **[[Climactic Encounter]]** - Purple
This Encounter is intended to advance the Narrative, but will also likely result in Combat. These should be tied directly into a Character Motivation at pivotal moment where they could succeed or fail. Stakes should be higher, and [[Victory]] should based on the Narrative, not necessarily Defeating an Enemy.
- Examples:

## **[[Story Encounter]]** - Blue
This Encounter is intended to advance the Narrative, such as meeting an important Character, or receiving news that might affect Character Motivation. These should always end in a decision being made or a new Narrative Path opening.

----
## **[[Discovery Encounter]]** - Green
This Encounter is intended to reveal something about the World, but also advance the Narrative. This could be uncovering important Lore or finding a hidden [[Point of Interest]]. 

----
## **[[Exploration Encounter]]** - Yellow
This Encounter is intended to reveal something about the World, like reaching a significant threshold, finding dangerous Flora, or navigating treacherous terrain. A [[Skill Test]] is a straight-forward way simultaneously teach Players about the [[Area]] they're Traveling through while give them a chance to creatively solve problems.

Failing one of these [[Skill Test]] should not feel too punishing, but should either re-route or delay the Players. Regardless of the outcome of the Encounter, Players should take a piece of this Area with them, either [[Crafting Materials]] or Area specific knowledge that will come in useful.

----
## **[[Territory Encounter]]** - Orange
This Encounter is intended to result in Combat for the purpose of revealing something about the World.
