# [[Combat Encounter]]


**Combat Principles**
- Don't have completely random combat encounters (unless you're into that sorta thing)
- Combat should have stakes other than just survival
	- Loot - Tease it before, demonstrate it during. Use it to manipulate a character that might want it.
	- Heroism - Save some innocent(?) victim

- Examples of non-KO Victory Conditions:
	- Survive a Siege / Hold a key Position
	- Target Dummy Competition / Combat Theater
	- Get to the Goal / Keep-Away
	- Make an Impression / Send a Message
	- Solve a Puzzle / Skill Check
	- Protect / Incapacitate a VIP
